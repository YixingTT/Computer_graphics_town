1. Please give attribution for your environment map image INCLUDING any conversion process you did.

I used the equirectangular picture given by Braeden Lisowski on piazza. 
Then I used the handy web converter given in the workbook to convert the equirectangular picture into cubemap.

2. Please explain what you were trying to make with your bump/normal map, and whether it is a bump or normal map.

Like the example given in class, I paint some white and black blurry dots to the surface has some sags and crests. It is a bump map.
