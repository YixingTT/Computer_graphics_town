1. What is the difference between a bump map and a normal map?

A normal map gives more information than a bump map. A normal map uses RGB information that corresponds with the X, Y, Z axix. 
A bump mapping uses grayscale values to decide the "Height" of the surface.

2. What is the difference between a "correct skybox" and simply putting a big cube around the world?

For a correct skybox, when we change the scale of the scene (like zoom in and zoom out), the skybox does not change.
While for putting a big cube around the world, the big cube will change its size as we change the scale of the scene.

3. Why is a sphere a good object for environment mapping, but a flat square is less good?

Environment mapping is actually reflecting the environment on a object. Since all 
the points on a sphere have different normals, the environment can be reflected 
very well. However for a flat square, the normal on a face is the same, thus the effect is not good.

4. What are the main choices for how to represent environment map images? Why might you pick one or the other?

There are two main ways sphere maps and cube maps. The advantage of sphere maps is 
it only use one single images but sphere maps have some sampling issues at pole. 
Cube maps have sampling issues in corners but it maps nicely to graphics hardware 
and the images are human viewable.
