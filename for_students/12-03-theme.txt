My town's theme is happiness town.

There are four parts of my town. The residential area has two houses to represent 
houses' group in this area. There is also a park in this area where parents can 
bring their kids to play. The main type of transportation is car in this part. 
The residential area is separated with other parts by a river.

A bridge connects the residential area with train station. In the middle of the 
train staion, there is a landmark which is a sphere reflecting the environment
around the town.

Near to the train station is a lake. There is a boat on the lake so that visitors 
can have fun there.

The last part is natural park. There are many trees and a hill. The dark green 
represents a higher altitude of this area.
