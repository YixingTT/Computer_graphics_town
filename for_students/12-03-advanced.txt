Advanced Thing: 

I tried to make a displacement map for the plane so that dark green part is higher 
than ligher green part representing a higher altitude. While displacement map is 
changing vertex shader and the plane is a flat surface so it is not work this way.
I do many searchs on how to change altitude of the surface but I did not find useful 
information to help me reach my expectation. But at least I put in my effort and 
tried to do that for a long time.

I also tried many ways to add snow effect the the town. The object Snow is in natural.js,
but it seems not right. I tried to generate 1000 random positions for snow particles. 
Then put every snow particle in a group and every time check the position of the snow 
article, if it goes out of the boundary, resign a new random value to the particle; if 
it is still in the boundary, reduce y values a little bit and reduce the x values twice 
as much as y does, so that the snow will fall down with some realistic slope. 

Train is an complex object, it is kind of challenging to put all the small pieces
(tyres, chimney, and carriage) together in the right place. Especially when the 
train is moving it envoloves many rotations and tranlations. Sometimes when the 
world axis is mixed up with local axis, it is really challenging to make things 
look right. 

Similar to train, quadcopter is also an complex object. The most challenging part is
the propeller. It is challenging to make it rotate while the quadcopter is flying.

I also think I include many different types of objects in this town to meet the 
requirement of diversity. Also it is not that much that makes audiences dazzling.
