Two kinds of objects created for this assignment:
1. Boat-0 (a boat on the lake use wood texture shader)
2. Mountain-0 (use bump map)

Five other kinds of objects that you created:
3. PyramidHip-0 (a house with texture mapping)
4. Tree-7 (made of simple primaries)
5. Carousel-0 (a object with up and down behavior)
6. Train-0 (a moviing object following track)
7. QuadCop-0 (a moving object flying around the town)

At least on of each type of object:
Building/structure: house: PyramidHip-0 (a house with texture mapping)
Vehicle: train: Train-0 (a moviing object following track)
Natural Element: tree: Tree-7 (made of simple primaries)

Object loaded from a model file:
Model: Objfile(./assets/bridge.obj) (use model)

An object with a shader that you wrote:
ShaderObj: Boat-0 (a boat on the lake use wood texture shader)
